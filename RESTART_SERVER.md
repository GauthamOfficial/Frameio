# 🔴 IMPORTANT: Dev Server Must Be Restarted

## The CSP Error Persists Because:

The `next.config.ts` changes **only load when Next.js starts**, NOT during hot reload.

## ✅ How to Fix (3 Steps):

### Step 1: Stop the Dev Server Completely
In your terminal where `npm run dev` is running:
1. Press `Ctrl+C`
2. Wait until you see "PS D:\My Files\Yarl IT Hub\Framio\frontend>"
3. Make SURE it has fully stopped (not just paused)

### Step 2: Start Fresh
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Hard Refresh Browser
After server restarts:
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Chrome/Edge) or `Ctrl+F5`
2. Or open DevTools → Right-click refresh → "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

## 🎯 Expected Result After Restart:

✅ No CSP errors about blob workers
✅ Clerk loads cleanly  
✅ Only see these normal warnings:
   - Development keys warning (expected in dev)
   - afterSignInUrl deprecation (non-critical)

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes:

❌ Just pressing Ctrl+C once (server might still be running)
❌ Using hot reload/Fast Refresh (doesn't reload config)
❌ Not refreshing the browser after restart

## 🔍 How to Verify It Worked:

1. Check terminal output - should see:
   ```
   ✓ Ready in Xs
   ○ Compiling / ...
   ```

2. Check browser console - CSP blob errors should be GONE

3. Look for these headers in DevTools → Network → any request → Response Headers:
   ```
   content-security-policy: ... worker-src 'self' blob: ...
   ```
