## Environment Configuration

Required environment variables:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

## Testing

The implementation includes:
- Role-based access control testing
- Permission-based UI rendering
- API integration testing
- Responsive design validation

## Next Steps

1. **Backend Integration**: Ensure backend APIs are properly configured
2. **Testing**: Implement comprehensive testing for all role-based features
3. **Error Handling**: Add more robust error handling for API failures
4. **Performance**: Optimize API calls and implement caching
5. **Security**: Add additional security measures for sensitive operations

## Notes

- All components are built with TypeScript for type safety
- UI follows the existing textile business theme
- Mobile responsiveness is maintained throughout
- Error states and loading states are properly handled
- Code is modular and follows React best practices
