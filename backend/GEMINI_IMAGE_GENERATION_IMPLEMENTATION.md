result = generator.generate_image(
    prompt="A beautiful textile design for saree with intricate patterns",
    aspect_ratio="1:1",
    style="photorealistic"
)
```

## ðŸ”§ **Setup Instructions**

### 1. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements_gemini.txt
```

### 2. **Configure API Key**
Set your Google Gemini API key in environment variables:
```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
# OR
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

### 3. **Test the Implementation**
```bash
cd backend
python test_gemini_image_generation.py
```

## ðŸ“Š **Example Scenarios Implemented**

### **1. Photorealistic Portrait**
```python
prompt = "A photorealistic close-up portrait of an elderly Japanese ceramicist with deep, sun-etched wrinkles and a warm, knowing smile. He is carefully inspecting a freshly glazed tea bowl. The setting is his rustic, sun-drenched workshop with pottery wheels and shelves of clay pots in the background. The scene is illuminated by soft, golden hour light streaming through a window, highlighting the fine texture of the clay and the fabric of his apron. Captured with an 85mm portrait lens, resulting in a soft, blurred background (bokeh). The overall mood is serene and masterful."
```

### **2. Kawaii Sticker**
```python
prompt = "A kawaii-style sticker of a happy red panda wearing a tiny bamboo hat. It's munching on a green bamboo leaf. The design features bold, clean outlines, simple cel-shading, and a vibrant color palette. The background must be white."
```

### **3. Minimalist Logo**
```python
prompt = "Create a modern, minimalist logo for a coffee shop called 'The Daily Grind'. The text should be in a clean, bold, sans-serif font. The design should feature a simple, stylized icon of a a coffee bean seamlessly integrated with the text. The color scheme is black and white."
```

### **4. Product Mockup**
```python
prompt = "A high-resolution, studio-lit product photograph of a minimalist ceramic coffee mug in matte black, presented on a polished concrete surface. The lighting is a three-point softbox setup designed to create soft, diffused highlights and eliminate harsh shadows. The camera angle is a slightly elevated 45-degree shot to showcase its clean lines. Ultra-realistic, with sharp focus on the steam rising from the coffee. Square image."
```
