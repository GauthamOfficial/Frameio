# üîß Settings Page Internal Server Error Fix

## üéØ Problem Identified

The Settings page was showing an "Internal Server Error" because:

1. **Clerk Authentication Not Configured**: The frontend was trying to use Clerk authentication but the environment variables were not set up
2. **Missing Environment Variables**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_FRONTEND_API` were not configured
3. **Authentication Failure**: The CompanyProfileSettings component was failing when trying to get user tokens

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- Updated `CompanyProfileSettings.tsx` to handle cases when Clerk is not configured
- Added development mode fallback for testing without authentication
- Improved error messages and logging

### 2. **Settings Page Improvements**
- Added Clerk configuration detection
- Added development mode warning banner
- Graceful fallback when authentication is not available

### 3. **Environment Setup Script**
- Created `setup-clerk-env.js` to help configure Clerk environment variables
- Provides step-by-step setup instructions

## üöÄ How to Fix

### Option 1: Quick Fix (Development Mode)
The Settings page will now work in development mode without Clerk configuration. You'll see a warning banner but the page will load.

### Option 2: Full Setup (Recommended)
1. **Run the setup script:**
   ```bash
   node setup-clerk-env.js
   ```

2. **Or manually configure:**
   - Get your Clerk keys from: https://dashboard.clerk.com
   - Create `frontend/.env.local`:
     ```
     NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_key_here
     NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_FRONTEND_API=your_clerk_frontend_api_here
     NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
     ```

3. **Restart your development servers:**
   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd backend && python manage.py runserver
   
   # Frontend  
   cd frontend && npm run dev
   ```

## üîç What Was Fixed

### Files Modified:
- `frontend/src/components/settings/CompanyProfileSettings.tsx`
- `frontend/src/app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx`
- `setup-clerk-env.js` (new)

### Key Changes:
1. **Graceful Clerk Detection**: Check if Clerk environment variables are configured
2. **Development Mode Fallback**: Allow the page to work without authentication in development
3. **Better Error Messages**: Clear indication when Clerk is not configured
4. **Setup Script**: Easy way to configure Clerk environment variables

## üß™ Testing

1. **Without Clerk Configuration:**
   - Settings page should load with a warning banner
   - Company profile settings should work in development mode

2. **With Clerk Configuration:**
   - Settings page should work normally with full authentication
   - No warning banner should appear

## üìù Notes

- The backend API is working correctly (tested with curl)
- The issue was purely on the frontend authentication side
- The fix maintains backward compatibility
- Development mode allows testing without full Clerk setup
